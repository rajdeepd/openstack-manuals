# SimpleWeb

A trivial app to demonstrate serving of static content using the Sinatra framework in Ruby.

Some sample / placeholder content is provided (styled with Bootstrap) but the expectation is that the user will replace the contents of the ``public`` directory with files for static serving by the Ruby app.

Read more about the motivation for this [on my blog](http://andypiper.co.uk/2012/08/21/a-simple-website-on-cloud-foundry/).

## Overview

This example uses:

- Ruby-Ruby-Ruby Ruby! :-)
- [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/)
- [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) for visual sugar
- the rather nice [Github Fork Ribbon in CSS](http://simonwhitaker.github.com/github-fork-ribbon-css/) by [Simon Whitaker](htt://twitter.com/s1mn)

## Deployment

What are all these files?

Nothing, really. No, really. Everything in the ``public`` folder is there as a *placeholder*. All you need to get going is the web.rb file (well, OK, you need the Gemfile and config.ru too). 

Put your own static web content (with an index.html file, and maybe a 404.html file) in the ``public`` folder, and either:

 * run ``bundle install`` then ``rackup`` from the root directory; or
 * deploy to Cloud Foundry as a Rack/Sinatra application
 
... and you are good to go.
 
Optionally, fiddle with the settings in the top of the web.rb file to tweak how things work.

There is an example Cloud Foundry manifest.yml(.example) file - if you wish to use this for one-push deployment, rename to manifest.yml and edit the name of the application to be something unique for your Cloud Foundry installation, or the push will fail. 


###Build python-api-guide

cd openstack-manuals/doc/python-api-guide
mvn clean generate-sources

the target directory is created with the contents of the build

###Copy the target dir

Copy the target/docbkx/webhelp/python-api-guide/* directory to openstack-manuals/deployment/python-api-guide/public

```bash
cd openstack-manuals/doc/deployment
cp -r ../python-api-guide/target/docbkx/webhelp/python-api-guide/* public/ 
```


###Login to cloud foundry
cf login

Pus the bits to the cloud foundry.
