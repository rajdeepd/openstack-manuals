  <title>LXC (Linux containers)</title>
  <para>LXC (also known as Linux containers) is a virtualization
    technology that works at the operating system level. This is
    different from hardware virtualization, the approach used by other
    hypervisors such as KVM, Xen, and VMWare. LXC (as currently
    implemented using libvirt in the nova project) is not a secure
    virtualization technology for multi-tenant environments
    (specifically, containers may affect resource quotas for other
    containers hosted on the same machine). Additional containment
    technologies, such as AppArmor, may be used to provide better
    isolation between containers, although this is not the case by
    default. For all these reasons, the choice of this virtualization
    technology is not recommended in production.</para>
  <para>If your compute hosts do not have hardware support for virtualization, LXC will likely
    provide better performance than QEMU. In addition, if your guests must access specialized
    hardware, such as GPUs, this might be easier to achieve with LXC than other hypervisors.</para>
  <note><para>Some OpenStack Compute features might be missing when running with LXC as the hypervisor. See
      the <link xlink:href="http://wiki.openstack.org/HypervisorSupportMatrix">hypervisor support
        matrix</link> for details.</para></note>
  <para>To enable LXC, ensure the following options are set in
      <filename>/etc/nova/nova.conf</filename> on all hosts running the <systemitem class="service"
      >nova-compute</systemitem>
    service.<programlisting language="ini">compute_driver=libvirt.LibvirtDriver
libvirt_type=lxc</programlisting></para>
  <para>On Ubuntu 12.04, enable LXC support in OpenStack by installing the
      <literal>nova-compute-lxc</literal> package.</para>
