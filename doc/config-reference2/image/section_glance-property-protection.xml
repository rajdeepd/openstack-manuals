    <title>Image property protection</title>
 <para>There are currently two types of properties in the Image
  Service: "core properties," which are defined by the system, and
  "additional properties," which are arbitrary key/value pairs that
  can be set on an image.</para>
 <para>With the Havana release, any such property can be protected
  through configuration. When you put protections on a property, it
  limits the users who can perform CRUD operations on the property
  based on their user role. The use case is to enable the cloud
  provider to maintain extra properties on images so typically this
  would be an administrator who has access to protected properties,
  managed with <filename>policy.json</filename>. The extra property
  could be licensing information or billing information, for
  example.</para>
  <para>Properties that don't have protections defined for them will
  act as they do now: the administrator can control core properties,
  with the image owner having control over additional properties.</para>
 <para>Property protection can be set in
   <filename>/etc/glance/property-protections.conf</filename>, using
  roles found in <filename>policy.json</filename>.</para>
