    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>An OpenStack Compute cloud is not very useful unless you have virtual machine images
        (which some people call "virtual appliances"). This guide describes how to obtain, create,
        and modify virtual machine images that are compatible with OpenStack.</para>
    <para>To keep things brief, we'll sometimes use the term "image" instead of "virtual machine
        image".</para>
        <para>What is a virtual machine image?</para>
        <para>A virtual machine image is a single file which contains a virtual disk that has a
            bootable operating system installed on it.</para>
    <para>Virtual machine images come in different formats, some of which are described below. In a
        later chapter, we'll describe how to convert between formats.</para>

            <term>Raw</term>
            <listitem><para>The "raw" image format is the simplest one, and is
                natively supported by both KVM and Xen hypervisors. You
                can think of a raw image as being the bit-equivalent of a
                block device file, created as if somebody had copied, say,
                <filename>/dev/sda</filename> to a file using the
                <command>dd</command> command. <note>
                    <para>We don't recommend creating raw images by dd'ing
                        block device files, we discuss how to create raw
                        images later.</para>

                copy-on-write version 2) format is commonly used with the KVM hypervisor. It has some
                additional features over the raw format, such as:<itemizedlist>

            <para>Because qcow2 is sparse, it's often faster to convert a raw image to qcow2 and upload
                it then to upload the raw file.</para>
            <para>
                <note>
                    <para>Because raw images don't support snapshots, OpenStack Compute will
                        automatically convert raw image files to qcow2 as needed.</para>

                Management Task Force (DMTF) standards group. An OVF package contains one or more image
                files, a .ovf XML metadata file that contains information about the virtual machine, and

            <para>An OVF package can be distributed in different ways. For example, it could be

            <para>OpenStack Compute does not currently have support for OVF packages, so you will need

                ISO a virtual machine image format, since ISOs contain bootable filesystems with an
                installed operating system, you can treat them the same you treat other virtual machine
